Welcome to my technical blog, not my personal one.

I do not like politicians or politics, but they say, “When an oppressed person turns into a cause, he must be supported.”…

There is a 55,000-year-old tree located in a blessed land called “Palestine.” This tree is the "olive tree".

That tree (the olive tree), which has been drenched with the blood of the landowners and has witnessed horrific crimes throughout the ages, also bears witness to more than 50 years of the crimes of the herds of Zionist settlers who desecrated the land and from whom humans, plants, animals, rocks, water, and even birds suffered.

More than 50 years of occupation and horrific crimes that must stop immediately, regardless of all affiliations (except Zionism).

Trees bear witness, humans, rocks, holy places, birds, water, everything here in this pure land bears witness to the truth that no one will ever be able to erase, just like that tree that no one has been able to uproot for thousands of years.

All salutes and appreciation to those roots that remained steadfast and clinging to the earth despite everything.

From **water to water** and **the river to the sea** Palestine will be free.
