> Follow the challenge details & instructions from [**here**](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/21#nav-overview) before the start.

> You can find the challenge questions [**here**](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/21#nav-questions)

given a **.zip** file: `c06-MalwareTrafficAnalysis3.zip` which contains a pcap file (The password of zip is: `cyberdefenders.org`)

Lets analyse the file and answer the questions...

## Q1. What is the IP address of the infected Windows host?

In **Brim**, Suricata alerts are showing 2 IPs related to Exploit Kit: `192.168.137.62` and `173.201.198.128`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/1.png)

Searching with `192.168.137.62 173.201.198.128 | sort ts` will display all logs related to these IPs:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/2.png)

To view the details of the `http` log, double-click on it.. You will notice that there is an HTTP request from `192.168.137.62` with a **user_agent** that specifies Windows as the operating system being used:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/3.png)

To make sure, Go to **NetworkMiner** and check Hosts.. There, You will find only 1 Windows host with the same IP, which is `192.168.137.62`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/4.png)
 
## Q2. What is the Exploit kit (EK) name? (two words)

**Brim** did not correctly identify the name of the exploit kit, So I used **VirusTotal** to scan the **pcap** file and check its IDS rules:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/5.png)

The answer is `Angler EK`.

## Q3. What is the FQDN that delivered the exploit kit?

To find the FQDN We need to get the associated IP, Just click on **View Matches**:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/6.png)

As you can see in the following image, The source IP that delivered the exploit-kit is `192.99.198.158` with port `80` ...

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/7.png)

Checking the host name of that IP in **NetworkMiner** will give us the FQDN which is `qwe.mvdunalterableairreport.net`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/8.png)

## Q4. What is the redirect URL that points to the exploit kit landing page?

I used the IP from the previous question to check the http connections in **Brim** by this filter `192.99.198.158 _path="http" | sort ts`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/9.png)

As you can see, the first connection has a referrer url: `http://lifeinsidedetroit.com/02024870e4644b68814aadfbb58a75bc.php?q=e8bd3799ee8799332593b0b9caa1f426` which is the redirect url that points to the exploit kit landing page.

## Q5. What is the FQDN of the compromised website?

To find the compromised website, we can follow/track all referrers in **Brim** starting from the landing page of the exploit-kit..

1. According to previous question, the 1st referrer we found is `http://lifeinsidedetroit.com/02024870e4644b68814aadfbb58a75bc.php?q=e8bd3799ee8799332593b0b9caa1f426`,

- I used this filter `"lifeinsidedetroit.com" http | sort ts` to display the http logs related to this domain:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/10.png)

2. As you can see, the 2nd referrer to the previous url is `http://adstairs.ro/544b29bcd035b2dfd055f5deda91d648.swf`, I filtered the logs with `adstairs.ro http | sort ts` again:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/11.png)

3. The 3rd referrer for the previous url is `http://www.earsurgery.org/`, So I did the same steps and filtered logs with `earsurgery.org http | sort ts`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/12.png)

4. As you can see, there are too many requests with a refferrer url `http://www.earsurgery.org/`..

if you scrolled up to check the first http connection, you will find that the host before `www.earsurgery.org` is `www.google.at` with no referrer which means that `www.earsurgery.org` is the compromised website which redirects the user to all other websites before the landing page.

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/13.png)

The answer will be `earsurgery.org`.

> **Note:** You can use **Wireshark** to check HTTP Request Sequences and you will get the same url for the compromised page.

## Q6. Which TCP stream shows the malware payload being delivered? Provide stream number

According to **Question 3**, We are already know the FQDN that delivered the exploit-kit which is `qwe.mvdunalterableairreport.net`...

Just go to **Wireshark** > `Export Objects` > `HTTP`, add `qwe.mvdunalterableairreport.net` as a text filter and save the files:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/14.png)

Upload them on **VirusTotal** to scan each one, you will notice that only 1 file has a label `angler payload`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/15.png)

File name is `680VBFhpBNBJOYXebSxgwLrtbh3g6JFUllqksWFSsGshhwsguyNL26MGul2oZ3b8` and its content-type in wireshark is `application/octet-stream`..

So, just click on the file from HTTP objects to move to its packet (2957), close the objects window, right-click on the packet and follow the TCP Stream:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/16.png)

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/17.png)

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/18.png)

As you can see in the previous image, Stream number (answer) is `80`.

## Q7. What is the IP address of the C&C server?

Go to **Brim** and check **Suricata Alerts**, There is a **Network Trojan** alert with a source IP `209.126.97.209` which is the C&C (Command & Control) server associated with the IP of the infected windows host `192.168.137.62`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/19.png)

## Q8. What is the expiration date of the SSL certificate?

To get the SSL certification of the C&C server, Just go to **Files** tab in **NetworkMiner** and add the IP of C&C that we got from previous question as a filter, then right-click on the web.cer file and select **Open file**:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/20.png)

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/21.png)

As can see, the expiration date is `24/11/2024`

## Q9. The malicious domain served a ZIP archive. What is the name of the DLL file included in this archive?

According to Question 3, The malicious domain is the one that delivered the exploit-kit and its IP is `192.99.198.158`.. So we can filter the traffic with it...

In **Brim**, searching with filter `application/zip` will show 2 logs:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/22.png)

From these 2 logs, The `uri` value in the http request is the zip file name which is `xPF_HAXN7TK9bMAgBjZDwQzO1-Wf5GvrN5_lIReIhbrhqHAlWyTDbaOBMPWitjnX`

We can get back to **Wireshark** to export this file & save it:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/23.png)

You can change the extension of the saved file to .rar or .zip to able to open it, you will find a dll file:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/24.png)

So, The dll name is `icVsx1qBrNNdnNjRI.dll`.

## Q10. Extract the malware payload, deobfuscate it, and remove the shellcode at the beginning. This should give you the actual payload (a DLL file) used for the infection. What's the MD5 hash of the payload?

According to **Question 6**, The malware payload is the file named `680VBFhpBNBJOYXebSxgwLrtbh3g6JFUllqksWFSsGshhwsguyNL26MGul2oZ3b8` that delivered by `qwe.mvdunalterableairreport.net`, So lets export and analyze it:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/25.png)

When I opened the file with **Notepad++** to check its content, I found some strings that are repeated many times with a specific pattern:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/26.png)

These values are:
`nhadR2b4`, `hadR2b4n`, `adR2b4nh`, `dR2b4nha`, `R2b4nhad`, `2b4nhadR`, `b4nhadR2`, `4nhadR2b`

Since I know the exploit-kit is called **Angler** from question2, I tried to search for angler exploit kit with 1 value every time and I used double-qoute with the values such as **"nhadR2b4"** to show only results that contains this value

For example: `angler exploit kit "nhadR2b4"` , `angler exploit kit "hadR2b4n"`, `angler exploit kit "adR2b4nh"` ... etc.

> **Note**: You can use google dorks to search for these values fast.

The only value that show a results was `adR2b4nh`... I saw [**this topic**](https://malware.dontneedcoffee.com/2014/08/angler-ek-now-capable-of-fileless.html) from 2014 that talking about **Angler EK**:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/27.png)

It says: "In Angler, each exploit has its own **Xor key**":

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/28.png)

From the previous image, the Xor key will be `adR2b4nh` and the CVE will be `CVE-2013-2551` ...

Now, We know that the malware payload xored with **adR2b4nh**, So We can xor it again with the same value to give us the original file... I used [**Cyberchef**](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) to do that:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/29.png)

Save the file & open it using a text/hex editor (be carefull don't run it, just use a text or hex editor)... Notice the DOS MZ Header & DOS Stub that says "This program cannot be run in DOS mode":

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/30.png)

> **Note:** Every file in the computer has its own signature according to this [**list**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_signatures). The signature of dll files in Hex is `4D 5A` which is `MZ`.

So the dll file we are searching for will start from `MZ` with hex value `4D 5A` before the DOS stub..

Till now and according to the question, we have extracted the malware payload, deobfuscated it. So We should remove the shell code at the beginning to give us the actual payload (dll file).. It is recommanded to do that by using a Hex Editor not a text editor, I will use [HxD](https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD20):

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/31.png)

Deleting the shellcode before `MZ` and saving the file:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/32.png)

Upload the saved file on [**VirusTotal**](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/upload) to check its MD5 hash:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/33.png)

As you see, the hash will be `3dfa337e5b3bdb9c2775503bd7539b1c` which is the correct answer.

**Important Note:** Most of dll files structure contains many Zeros (0's), and If they get Xored with XOR Key value, The result will be the same XOR Key value and you can see this XOR Key value repeated in the content of the new xored obfuscated file instead of 0's.........

According to the previous note, In the beginning of the answer for this question We saw too many strings that repeated many times with a specific pattern ! And since We know that it contains a **dll** file.. Then It means the Obfuscation technique has done with XOR algorithm which used one of the repeated values that we got in the beginning.. So, instead of searching on google and waste the time, We can do XOR Bruteforcing with the repeated values or just try to xor the file with each value to get the right one which contains a PE file (dll).

## Q11. What were the two protection methods enabled during the compilation of the PE file? (comma-separated)

I used **pesec** tool to check the protection methods of the dll (pe) file that we found before and this is the result:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/34.png)

The 2 methods will be `SEH` and `Stack cookies` but The answer format is `S..,.....y`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/35.png)

When I googled **Stack cookies** I found that it is also known as **canaries**, So the answer will be `SEH,Canary`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/36.png)

## Q12. When was the DLL file compiled?

Uploaing the dll file on **VirusTotal** again and checking **Portable Execution Info** section in **details** tab will give us the **Compilation Timestamp** which is `09/01/2002`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/37.png)

## Q13. A Flash file was used in conjunction with the redirect URL. What URL was used to retrieve this flash file?

Use the redirection URL found in **Question 4** which is `http://lifeinsidedetroit.com/02024870e4644b68814aadfbb58a75bc.php?q=e8bd3799ee8799332593b0b9caa1f426` to filter the logs in **Brim**, and then check the related http connections to it...

I used this search query `"lifeinsidedetroit.com" _path="http" | sort ts` which display the sorted http connections related to **lifeinsidedetroit.com**:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/38.png)

So, The referrer url `http://adstairs.ro/544b29bcd035b2dfd055f5deda91d648.swf` is the URL that used to retrieve the flash file.

**Another way** to solve the question is to filter the logs with `_path="files" flash` to show only files that contains "flash" word:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/39.png)

2 flash files found, just check their http connections details and you will find the same answer as the host is `adstairs.ro` and the uri is `/544b29bcd035b2dfd055f5deda91d648.swf` ... The final answer will be the full url `http://adstairs.ro/544b29bcd035b2dfd055f5deda91d648.swf`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/40.png)

## Q14. What is the CVE of the exploited vulnerability?

We have got the CVE in **Question 10** which is `CVE-2013-2551`.

## Q15. What was the web browser version used by the infected host?

We are already know the IP of the infected host from **Question 1** which is `192.168.137.62`, So We can use this `_path="http" 192.168.137.62` to filter the logs in **Brim** and the double-click on any http request to get the user-agent `Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MSIE 9.0; Windows NT 6.1; WOW64; Trident/5.0)`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/41.png)

From user-agent, **MSIE 9.0** Means that the browser version is `9`.

## Q16. What is the DNS query that had the highest RTT?

Using `_path="dns" | sort -r rtt` filter in **Brim** will show up the DNS that had the highest RTT which is `ssl.gstatic.com`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/42.png)

## Q17. What the name of the SSL certificate issuer that appeared the most? (one word)

Using `_path="ssl" | sort issuer` filter in **Brim** will show up the certificate issuer that appeared the most which is `Google`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta3/43.png)
