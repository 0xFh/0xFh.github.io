### Scenario:

You're working as a soc analyst at a Security Operations Center (SOC) for a Thanksgiving-themed company. One quiet evening, you hear someone knocking at the SOC analyst's entrance.  As you answer the door, an exhausted mail server technician stumbles in and quickly falls to the floor.  He whispers in a shaky voice, "Mail filters are down...  Spam everywhere..."

As you help him up, he looks to the sky and yells, "The gates of hell have opened!"The technician immediately collapses again and softly whispers, "The horror...  The horror...".

The mail filter outage lasted throughout the next day.  Fortunately, very few incidents were reported.  But one example caught your eye. During the mail filter outage, one of the company employees decided to play "email roulette."  The employee opened one of the malicious emails from his inbox and treated it as a legitimate message.

**YOUR ASSIGNMENT**

You acquired four malicious emails the employee received.  You also received a pcap of traffic from his infected computer.  Your task?  Figure out which email was used to compromise the system.

> Follow the challenge details & instructions from [here](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/58#nav-overview) before the start

> You can find the challenge questions [here](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/58#nav-questions)

given a **.zip** file: `c41-MTA5` which contains 1 pcap file and 4 email files (The password of zip is: `cyberdefenders.org`)

Lets answer the questions...

## Q1. c41-MTA5-email-01: What is the name of the malicious file?

Open `c41-MTA5-email-01.eml` file, save the **zip** file from the attachments and then open it to see the malicious file:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/1.png)

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/2.png)

## Q2. c41-MTA5-email-01: What is the name of the trojan family the malware belongs to? (As identified by emerging threats ruleset).

Upload the malware on VirusTotal, you will get the name of the trojan family:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/3.png)

You can do it with **Hybrid-Analysis** or **Any.run** as well.

## Q3. c41-MTA5-email-02: Multiple streams contain macros in this document. Provide the number of the highest one.

Open **c41-MTA5-email-02.eml** file, extract the xls file from the attachments, then use **Oledump** tool to see the number of streams in the xls file:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/4.png)

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/5.png)

As you can see, the number of the highest one is `20`.

## Q4. c41-MTA5-email-02: The Excel macro tried to download a file. Provide the full URL of this file?

You can extract the macro and get the URL by many ways:

1- Upload the Excel file on VirusTotal and check **Relations** or **Behavior** tab to see the contacted URL which is used to download the file and this is the answer:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/6.png)

2- Upload the Excel file on **Hybrid-Analysis**, go to Indicators > Informative, you will find the VBA code under **Contains embedded VBA macros**, You can copy it to txt file and then analyze it:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/7.png)

3- Another way to get the VBA code is using **Olevba** or similar tool to extract the vba and then analyze it:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/07.png)

I used this command: `olevba -c '.\Bill Payment_000010818.xls' > vba.txt` to extract the code from the excel file and then redirect the output (code) to a file called vba.txt

> Note: If you want to install **olevba** on Windows check this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52pFz8sYMFs)

The following are additional steps for analyzing the VBA code, You can get the url from **VirusTotal** directly as I said...

### VBA code analysis
The Question is asking about URL that download a file, I know that http request in VBA can be done with **XMLHTTPRequest** object but searching for it in the VBA code didn't show anything:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/8.png)

One of interesting methods in this object is **.open()** and **.send()**... So I searched for **.Open** and **.Send** and I got this suspicious line which is creating an obfuscated GET Request using **Pochemu** function with 2 paramteres; An intersting array which is **valdis** and number **59** :

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/9.png)

Look at this example of GET request that I found on the internet:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/10.png)

The structre format of **Open** method is `"GET", URL, False`, So If you get back to VBA code you will notice that the returned value of `Pochemu(valdis, 59)` will be the **URL** that is used in this method...

Lets check the Pochemu function:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/11.png)

As you can see, The 2 variables in the function `Z` and `oldLen` which are `valdis` array and number `59` from the previous step... So We can write this line `Chr(Z(n) - 4 * oldLen - 6000)` as `chr(valdis[] - 4 * 59 - 6000)`...

Now, We can write a python code to get the full URL:

```
valdis = [6340, 6352, 6352, 6348, 6294, 6283, 6283, 6333, 6336, 6354, 6333, 6346, 6335, 6337, 6336, 6339, 6350, 6347, 6353, 6348, 6282, 6346, 6337, 6352, 6282, 6333, 6353, 6283, 6362, 6341, 6346, 6335, 6333, 6346, 6352, 6341, 6346, 6283, 6287, 6287, 6288, 6339, 6289, 6342, 6291, 6290, 6283, 6292, 6293, 6291, 6341, 6291, 6353, 6356, 6349, 6337, 6282, 6337, 6356, 6337]

url = ""
for i in range(len(valdis)):
	url += chr(valdis[i] - 4 * 59 - 6000)
print(url)
```

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/12.png)

As you can see, `http://advancedgroup.net.au/~incantin/334g5j76/897i7uxqe.exe` is the URL of the downloaded file.

## Q5. c41-MTA5-email-02: What is the name of the object used to get data from the download URL?

Back to the previous question and check the example of GET request structure, you will notice the object is used as `MSXML2.XMLHTTP`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/13.png)

And according to the following image that we got in the previous question:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/14.png)

The URL is passed as a paramter to **Open** method which belongs to `read_same_ch_from3` object, So We should check its definition by searching for its name:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/15.png)

As you can see, It use this line to create the ojbect: `CreateObject("Microsof" + zilibobe + ".XMLH" + UCase(zilibobe) + "TP")`.. So, To get the object We should first get the value of **zilibobe** variable by searching for it:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/16.png)

As we can see, **zilibobe** is equal to **"t"**, So the final format will be `CreateObject("Microsof" + "t" + ".XMLH" + "T" + "TP")` which is `Microsoft.XMLHTTP`.

## Q6. c41-MTA5-email-02: The Excel macro writes a file to the temp folder. Provide the filename?

You can solve this question by analyzing the VBA, But I will not waste the time .. We can just upload the excel file on VirusTotal and check the **Files Written** section under **Behavior** tab:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/17.png)

As you can see, There is only 1 written file in Temp directory with the name `tghtop.exe` and this is the correct answer.

## Q7. c41-MTA5-email-03: Provide the FQDN used by the attacker to store the login credentials?

Open **c41-MTA5-email-03.eml** file, save the html file from the attachments:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/18.png)

Upload the file on **Hybrid-Analysis** or search with its Hash and then you will get the answer as you can see in the following image:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/19.png)

The FQDN will be `jpmmotos.pt`.

## Q8. c41-MTA5-email-04: How many FQDNs are present in the malicious js?

Open **c41-MTA5-email-04.eml** file, save the .zip file from the attachments:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/20.png)

The zip file contains only 1 js file, extract it and use any text-editor to view its content:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/21.png)

As you can see, The code seems to be obfuscated.. We can use any js beautifier such as [**de4js**](https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/) to de-obfuscate it and then we can analyze it easly:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/22.png)

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/022.png)

As you can see in the first line of code, there are `3` FQDN which are `kennedy.sitoserver.com`, `nzvincent.com`, `abama.org`

Another way to get the FQDNs through Hybrid-Analysis or Any.run and check the network analysis section:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/23.png)

As you can see, there are `3` FQDNs and this is the answer.

## Q9. c41-MTA5-email-04: What is the name of the object used to handle and read files?

Check `xa` variable in the de-obfuscated js code:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/023.png)

As you can see, **xo** is used to handle GET request while **xa** is used to open, write and close files.. Check the definition line of **xa** and you will notice that the object name is `ADODB.Stream`.

> **Note:** **Adodb.stream** is an object that is used to read files other streams, It used in VBA code to manage binary data and work with them.

**Another way to solve the question through Hybrid Analysis:**

Go to **Hybrid-Analysis** and click on **WScript.exe** process to view more details about it:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/24.png)

In the Script calls tab, notice that there are 3 created objects using **CreateObject** method which are `WScript.Shell`, `MSXML2.XMLHTTP`, `ADODB.Stream`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/25.png)

Since the answer format is **A....S....**, So the right one will be `ADODB.Stream`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/26.png)

## Q10. c41-MTA5.pcap: The victim received multiple emails; however, the user opened a single attachment. Provide the attachment filename.

We have got 4 domains from **Questions 7 & 8**, which are `jpmmotos.pt`, `abama.org`, `kennedy.sitoserver.com`, and `nzvincent.com` ... So, We can use them to filter the logs **Brim** to see which one that the user opened..

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/27.png)

As you can see, only that domain `kennedy.sitoserver.com` is showing some logs which means that user opened the attachment related to this domain..

According to **Question8**, The attachment exists in **c41-MTA5-email-04.eml** file and its name is `fax000497762.zip`.

## Q11. c41-MTA5.pcap: What is the IP address of the victim machine?

The HTTP logs in the previous question is showing that the victim IP is sending an HTTP Get Request to the domain.. So, the IP of the **victim machine** is `10.3.66.103`.. and the IP of **kennedy.sitoserver.com** host is `174.121.246.162`

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/28.png)

## Q12. c41-MTA5.pcap: What is the hostname of the victim machine?

Go to **NetworkMiner** and check the associated host to the victim domain:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/29.png)

As you can see, the Hostname is `Strout-PC`.

## Q13. c41-MTA5.pcap: What is the FQDN that hosted the malware?

According to **Question 10**, the FQDN that host the malware will be `kennedy.sitoserver.com`.

If you want to make sure of that, Use the host IP from **Question 11** to filter the alert logs in **Brim** and you will see only 2 IPs, the victim `10.3.66.103` and the host `174.121.246.162` which is `kennedy.sitoserver.com`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/30.png)

## Q14. c41-MTA5.pcap: The opened attachment wrote multiple files to the TEMP folder. Provide the name of the first file written to the disk?

Go the the de-obfuscated js code and notice the following lines in the image:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/31.png)

The variable **fn** is used in saving the file in **Temp** folder with a name **799755** and it will add the value of **n** and **.exe** to the name of the file every loop...

The value of **n** in the first loop (The first file will be written) is **1**, So The filename will be **799755** + **1** + **.exe** which equal to `7997551.exe` and this is the answer.

## Q15. c41-MTA5.pcap: One of the written files to the disk has the following md5 hash "35a09d67bee10c6aff48826717680c1c"; Which registry key does this malware check for its existence?

Go to **Brim** and use the md5 hash as filter it will show only 1 file log related to the victim host and **kennedy.sitoserver.com** host..

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/32.png)

Now go to **Wireshark** > **Export Objects** > **HTTP** and add `kennedy.sitoserver.com` in text filter to show only related files to this host:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/33.png)

As you can see, there are 3 gif files with different sizes, to determine which one is correct just back to **Brim** and check the total_bytes of the file which is **464,384** (464 KB):

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/34.png)

Back to **Wireshark** and save the file with 464kB in size..

We can use many different ways to get the registry key such as static or dynamic analysis for the file, online scanning ..etc.

In Static Analysis, **Strings** shows that there is only 1 registry key which is **interface\{9a83a958-b859-11d1-aa90-00aa00ba3258}**:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/35.png)

So, The answer will be `9a83a958-b859-11d1-aa90-00aa00ba3258`

You can make sure of that by analyzing the file using Disassembler/Debugger, or by using Online Scanner/Sandbox and you will get the same key.

## Q16. c41-MTA5.pcap: One of the written files to the disk has the following md5 hash "e2fc96114e61288fc413118327c76d93" sent an HTTP post request to "upload.php" page. Provide the webserver IP. (IP is not in PCAP)

Do the same steps in the previous question to extract the correct file from **Wireshark**:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/36.png)

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/37.png)

Upload the extracted file on **VirusTotal** and go to **Relations** tab, You will find that there is only 1 IP under **Contacted IP addresses** which is `78.24.220.229` and this is the correct answer:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/38.png)

## Q17. c41-MTA5.pcap: The malware initiated callback traffic after the infection. Provide the IP of the destination server.

Use the victim IP in **Brim** and sort the result by the time using this filter: `10.3.66.103 | sort ts` then scroll down to the last alert log:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta5/39.png)

Notice that, there is a callback traffic after the infection between the victim IP and `109.68.191.31` IP which is the answer.

Thanks for reading.
