**Challenge Requirements:**
- Wireshark
- Network Miner
- BrimSecurity & Suricata (Just follow the video instructions on the details page)
- VirusTotal Website
- PE Tool (Such as **PeStudio**, **Winchecksec** or **psec** in Linux)

> Follow the challenge details & instructions from [here](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/20#nav-overview) before the start.

> You can find the challenge questions [here](https://cyberdefenders.org/blueteam-ctf-challenges/20#nav-questions)

given a **.zip** file: `c05-MalwareTrafficAnalysis2.zip` which contains a pcap file (The password of zip is: `cyberdefenders.org`)

Lets analyse the file and answer the questions...
___

## Q1. What is the IP address of the Windows VM that gets infected?

By using **NetworkMiner**, we can get the IP & MAC addresses of the infected Windows VM:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/1.png)

We can use **Brim** to make sure that the IP address is `172.16.165.132`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/2.png)
 
## Q2. What is the MAC address of the infected VM?

Already solved in the previous question.

## Q3. What are the IP address and port number that delivered the exploit kit and malware?

Checking suricata logs in **Brim** again, the IP is `37.143.15.180`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/3.png)

To get the port number associated with this IP, just filter the logs with the IP and you will get the port which is `51439`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/4.png)

You can get it from **Hosts** tab in **NetworkMiner** also:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/5.png)

## Q4. What are the two FQDN's that delivered the exploit kit? comma-separated in alphabetical order.

Just filter the data in **Brim** with `37.143.15.180 | sort ts` to show only connections and alerts related to the IP that delivered the Exploit Kit:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/6.png)

As you can see in the image, an http connection to `h.trinketking.com` happened before the first alert of the Exploit Kit, and another http connection to `g.trinketking.com` happened before the second alert of the other Exploit Kit.

So, The answer will be `g.trinketking.com,h.trinketking.com`

You can also get the answer from last image in the previous question.

## Q5. What is the IP address of the compromised web site?

By Checking HTTP Conversations from statistics in **Wireshark**.. The conversation from the infected host `172.16.165.132` to this IP `192.30.138.146` has the most number of packets (1376):

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/7.png)

Checking HTTP Endpoints show the same result that IP `192.30.138.146` has the most number of packets (1376) after the infected host (4682):

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/8.png)

tried to submit this IP and it was the correct answer.

> **Note:** To solve this type of questions, just follow the referrers starting from the website that devlivered the exploit-kit to the first website which the victim opended such as google.com or bing.com ... etc. and you will find the compromised website which redirects the victim to all other pages including the page that delivered the EK.

## Q6. What is the FQDN of the compromised website?

In **Wireshark**, if We use this filter `ip.addr == 192.30.138.146 && http` to show the HTTP connections related to this ip, We will get the hostname or FQDN of it:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/9.png)

Same result in **Brim**:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/10.png)

So the answer will be `hijinksensue.com`

## Q7. What is the name exploit kit (EK) that delivered the malware? (two words)

In Brim, just use `event_type="alert" Exploit Kit` to show alerts that contains "Exploit Kit" to get the name of the Exploit Kit which is `Sweet Orange`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/11.png)

## Q8. What is the redirect URL that points to the exploit kit landing page?

To find the landing page of the exploit kit, I checked all http connections related to the exploit kit alert logs in the previous image in question7 and I found something interesting..

just double-click on the last alert which contains `ET EXPLOIT_KIT Sweet Orange CDN Gate` to show its details, click on `conn` to show the connections, and then select `http` to check the http connection as the following images:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/12.png)

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/13.png)

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/14.png)

In the previous image, there is an **http** request before the **alert** which sending a **GET** request to **host**: `static.charlotteretirementcommunities.com` with **uri**: `/k?tstmp=3701802802` and its IP is `50.87.149.90` ...

since the answer format matches the url format that we found, the answer will be the full url (host+uri) which is `static.charlotteretirementcommunities.com/k?tstmp=3701802802`.

## Q9. What is the IP address of the redirect URL that points to the exploit kit landing page?

I got the IP in the previous question.

## Q10. Extract the malware payload (PE file) from the PCAP. What is the MD5 hash?

I used this filter `mime_type="application/x-dosexec"` to show the executable files in **Brim** logs and I have found only 1 file with md5 hash: `1408275c2e2c8fe5e83227ba371ac6b3` and this is the correct answer:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/15.png)

If you are using **Wireshark**, just go to **Export Objects > HTTP** and search for application files that related to the the host which delivered the exploit-kit (we got it in question4 already)..

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/16.png)

Save it and then upload the file on **VirusTotal** to get the MD5 hash.

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/17.png)

## Q11. What is the CVE of the exploited vulnerability?

According to **Question7**, using the same filter `event_type="alert" Exploit Kit` in **Brim** will show the CVE which is `CVE-2014-6332` as we can see:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/18.png)

## Q12. What is the mime-type of the file that took the longest time (duration) to be analyzed using Zeek?

In **Brim**, We can filter logs to show only files and sort them with the (duration) using this filter `_path="files" | sort -r duration`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/19.png)

As we can see, the mime-type is `application/x-dosexec` which is the PE file that we got before.

## Q13. What was the referrer for the visited URI that returned the file "f.txt"?

In **Brim**, add this filter `f.txt _path="http" | sort ts` and scroll right to see the referrer which is `http://hijinksensue.com/assets/verts/hiveworks/ad1.html`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/20.png)

## Q14. When was this PCAP captured?

You can get it easly in **Brim** as the following image:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/21.png)

The answer will be `23/11/2014`.

## Q15. When was the PE file compiled?

Back to **Question10**, check **details** page on **VirusTotal**, scroll down and check **Portable Executable Info** and you will see that **Compilation Timestamp** is `21/11/2014`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/22.png)

## Q16. What is the name of the SSL certificate issuer that appeared only once? (one word)

In **Brim**, use `_path="ssl" | sort issuer` filter and go to the **issuer** column, you will find that `Cybertrust` appeared only once:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/23.png)

## Q17. What were the two protection methods enabled during the compilation of the present PE file? Format: comma-separated in alphabetical order

To check the protection methods of the PE files, We have many tools such as PeStudio, Winchecksec, pesec ... etc.

- **Pestudio** output:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/24.png)

- **pesec** output:

![](/assets/img/uploads/malware_traffic__analysis/mta2/25.png)

Since the answer format needs only 2 methods and starts with 'D..,...' , then the right answer will be `DEP,SEH`.
