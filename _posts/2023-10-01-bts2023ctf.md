### D0Ts

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/2.png)

Flag: `Flag{Morse_code}`

## easywin

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/3.png)

The link provided is for a sign-in page that asks for the user's email and password:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/4.png)

After inspecting the source page, I discovered obfuscated JS code:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/5.png)

I used this [**website**](https://lelinhtinh.github.io/de4js/) to deobfuscate the code, and this is the output:

```
(function (_0x913661, _0x4d120b) {
    const _0x56f777 = _0x1854,
        _0x47f5f7 = _0x913661();
    while (!![]) {
        try {
            const _0x335d48 = parseInt(_0x56f777(0x84)) / 0x1 + -parseInt(_0x56f777(0x8f)) / 0x2 * (parseInt(_0x56f777(0x82)) / 0x3) + -parseInt(_0x56f777(0x86)) / 0x4 * (parseInt(_0x56f777(0x8a)) / 0x5) + parseInt(_0x56f777(0x87)) / 0x6 * (parseInt(_0x56f777(0x90)) / 0x7) + -parseInt(_0x56f777(0x85)) / 0x8 * (-parseInt(_0x56f777(0x8c)) / 0x9) + parseInt(_0x56f777(0x92)) / 0xa + parseInt(_0x56f777(0x88)) / 0xb;
            if (_0x335d48 === _0x4d120b) break;
            else _0x47f5f7 'push';
        } catch (_0x3db4e3) {
            _0x47f5f7 'push';
        }
    }
}(_0x58be, 0x6bc9e));

function _0x1854(_0x375900, _0x1e7699) {
    const _0x58be1f = _0x58be();
    return _0x1854 = function (_0x185496, _0x39c5df) {
        _0x185496 = _0x185496 - 0x81;
        let _0x5d0d96 = _0x58be1f[_0x185496];
        return _0x5d0d96;
    }, _0x1854(_0x375900, _0x1e7699);
}

function login() {
    const _0x590ed8 = _0x1854,
        _0x4fb772 = document 'getElementById' [_0x590ed8(0x83)],
        _0x39e137 = document 'getElementById' ['value'],
        _0x2e7bab = _0x590ed8(0x89),
        _0x220f2d = 'password';
    _0x4fb772 === _0x2e7bab && _0x39e137 === _0x220f2d ? window[_0x590ed8(0x8b)]
    'replace': alert(_0x590ed8(0x8e));
}

function _0x58be() {
    const _0x129aca = ['email', '5055890brylTr', 'password', '291ADApiL', 'value', '111915TuoPIH', '74064qFLpju', '4bGPcQf', '6PzkuAP', '6597877lorJsv', 'admin@mail.com', '3394165HJcJMq', 'location', '306tMZOOY', '5up3rs3cr3t.html', 'Invalid email or password. Please try again.', '16842eIDCgi', '2835623pvkZea'];
    _0x58be = function () {
        return _0x129aca;
    };
    return _0x58be();
}
```

There is an HTML page called `5up3rs3cr3t.html`, and when I visited this page, it displayed an error (not found). In order to understand the function, I analyzed it and found that it checks for the values of 2 elements (email and password) from the array (_0x129aca) as follows:

```
_0x129aca[0] = _0x129aca[10]
_0x129aca[2] = _0x129aca[2]
```
That means email = `admin@mail.com` and password = `password`, So I tried to sign in with these credentials, and the flag showed up:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/6.png)

Another way to get the right credentials:

- Ask **Chatgpt** about the email and password in this function, and it will give you the right one.
- Use the debugger in the developer tools in your browser to get the values that were compared with your input.
- [Don't] Use the provided email and bruteforce the password with all elements of the array (bruteforcing is not allowed; be careful).

Flag: `flag{Cl13nt_4uth_15_t00_b4d}`

### Qakbot Case

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/7.png)

In this challenge, we have an event log file called **powershell.evtx**..

I opened the file with **EventViewer** and searched for any suspicious event, but it is not easy to search with EventViewer. So I used [**evtxtract**](https://github.com/williballenthin/EVTXtract) tool to extract the event logs as XML logs to make the search process easy..

You can install it via pip: `pip install evtxtract` ..

To use the tool, just pass the input and output to it using this command: `evtxtract powershell.evtx > logs.xml` as follows:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/8.png)

The output file will look like this:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/9.png)

Backing to the challenge description We can see a **Note** saying `the domain name ends with .br`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/10.png)

So, I searched for all **.br** occurances in the logs file, and I found only 1 result:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/11.png)

So the flag is: `flag{graficalevi.com.br}` .

### D4rkHun7

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/12.png)

In this challenge, we are asked to find the mobile signing key of someone who manages a darkweb market called **AlphaBay** ..

The only information we know is the market name `AlphaBay` So I searched for **AlphaBay** market, and I found that it is a real story, and the co-founder of the market is called `Alexandre Cazes`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/13.png)

I used his name (Alexandre Cazes) to search for any personal information, and I found many articles saying how police arrested him through his personal email, which is `Pimp_Alex_91@hotmail.com`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/14.png)

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/15.png)

I searched for his email, and I found an interesting website called **keybase.io** that contains a profile for him:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/16.png)

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/17.png)

The previous image shows a device icon, and when I clicked on it, it brought me to the following tab, which contains his mobile and the signing key:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/18.png)

The mobile signing key is `01202cfd4f25d1b8208b3bfcfb3601c5ba32a3b842b7cbb522b69216932e6502da170a` as you can see.

So the flag will be `flag{01202cfd4f25d1b8208b3bfcfb3601c5ba32a3b842b7cbb522b69216932e6502da170a}` .

### Job

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/19.png)

Given a .7z file that contains an email file called **Job_Application.eml** and it looks like the following:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/20.png)

There is an attachment file called **Job-Application.docm**, and this is what it looks like:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/21.png)

First, I scanned the word file with ![VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/9c9bd6b80e81f77ab18ff51cba042b41e4f0f68c71c2110d4dde9d674e5d0997/behavior) but I didn't see any IP or Port:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/22.png)

I was thinking about macros or embedded XML files in this document, so I used ![OleVBA](https://github.com/decalage2/oletools/wiki/olevba), and I found a VBA code in a file called vbaProject.bin:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/23.png)

The output contains some IOCs that contain a URL, IP address, Port number, and Base64 value which is sending an HTTP Get request to `http://162.219.145.2:184` :

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/24.png)

You can decode the base64 itself and check the GET request:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/25.png)

So, I tried to submit the IP and Port in the URL in the flag format and it was correct.

Flag: `Flag{162.219.145.2:184}`

### T3ST4R

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/26.png)

The .zip file contains a pcap file, so I opened it in Brim to check Suricata and Zeek alerts, but I didn't find any suspicious alerts.

The file is large, so I used **NetworkMiner** before Wireshark to get some information about the traffic:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/27.png)

- 224 Hosts
- 141 Files
- 3 Images
- ...etc.

When checking the Files tab, I found a file named **flag[1].jpg**, but I found that it was just a fake flag:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/28.png)

I also checked the 3 images in the Images tab to see if there was important data in them with [**Exiftool**](https://exiftool.org/), but I didn't get any useful information; they were just stupid images:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/29.png)

When I was checking Credentials tab I found a Cookie contains PHP Session ID and MIME contains a sqli payload `'or 1=1#` in the username and password as the following:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/30.png)

I noticed something interesting: the client which is 192.168.235.137, and the server which is 192.168.1.7 are the same hosts in the previous Images tab that sent and received images and PHP files:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/31.png)

There is a good hint in the description of the challenge: "Someone hacked our website..." So I opened Wireshark and used the HTTP filter to check the traffic:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/32.png)

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/33.png)

As you can see, there are some OCSP packets before HTTP packets whose source and destination have the same IP addresses that we found before in images and PHP files..

So, I followed the TCP stream of the first HTTP frame (19157) to know what was happening:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/34.png)

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/35.png)

As you can see, the first stream (84) contains a GET request to corp.co.com, and the response is a login page that asks for a username and password with POST method.

Skipping the next Cert stream (85) and checking Stream (86):

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/36.png)

The client sent a POST request with a SQL Injection payload `'or 1=1#` in the username and password and then tried to reach out the **panel.php** which contains a file upload function with POST method also:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/37.png)

In the next stream (87), the client uploaded a png image file called **2020-03-feature-giraffe_tcm7-269465.png** through the previous upload page (panel.php), and the response is saying "file uploaded at uploads/2020-03-feature-giraf....":

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/38.png)

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/39.png)

I checked the data in the image and I found that it was the same image that I found in NetworkMiner before (nothing suspicious).

In the next stream (88), the client uploaded another image file called **607184884-american-horror-story-tate-quotes-218.png**, but nothing suspicious in the image data:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/40.png)

In the next stream (89), the client uploaded another image file called **elephant.php.png**, but the header of the image was very interesting because it is not a correct header for png image files; it starts with **<?php**:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/41.png)

After checking the content of the image, I found a PHP code:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/42.png)

The code is opening a socket with ip **192.168.1.10** on **443** port and trying to download the icon file from this url `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PentestoMonkey/icons/main/favicon.ico` through the **wget** command, then it will save the file into **/path/to/save** folder...

So I tried to download this file through **wget** command using the following command `wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PentestoMonkey/icons/main/favicon.ico`:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/43.png)

Since I know it may be a malicious file, I didn't open it directly, but I just checked its metadata with Exiftool and Strings, and that is what I found with Strings:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/44.png)

It is a PHP code that checks if the cmd parameter is present, and then it will execute a command through the system() function. It then echoes the output followed by the string ``cP['_!oE^n^MEso@`_PeECbhg%"[ap20$_Zu*kQj)*;UD8Pq_d_tYEg!B`. Finally the script terminates using die() function.

So this weird string seems to be encrypted or encoded. I tried [**Cyberchef**](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) and used the **Magic** recipe with **Intensive mode** and gave it the plaintext part of the flag format that I know which is **flag{**, and that is the result:

![](/assets/img/uploads/bts2023/ctf/45.png)

As you see, the weird string is encoded by Base85 and the result is the flag which is `Flag{0H_1M_H3R3_MY_FR13N6_Y0u_G0T_My_B4CKD00R}`.

Well done !


I didn't write about Hard Challenge **History 102** because I stuck on the 3rd part of the flag and I could solve it after the competition when I knew the hives were moved into the winevt folder by mistake.
